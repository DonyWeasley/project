### How It Works:
1. **Prefix Notation**:  
   Example: `+ - 2 3 * 3 4`
2. **Infix Notation**:  
   Example: `( ( 1 + 2 ) + ( 2 / 3 ) )`
3. **Postfix Notation**:

## **Game Rental Store** (C++)

To download the project file, click [here](https://github.com/DonyWeasley/project/blob/main/project/game%20rental%20store.cpp)

A command-line program that simulates a **game rental service**. Users can interact with the program by answering questions in a **step-by-step format**, and the program provides a summary and generates a **receipt in a .txt file** if the user requests it.

### How It Works:
1. The user is asked how many games they want to rent (up to 5).  
2. The user specifies the rental duration (in days).  
3. The user is asked how many people will split the rental cost.  
4. The user selects the games they want to rent by entering the corresponding number for each game.  
5. The program calculates the total cost and displays a summary of the rental details.  
6. The user is asked whether they want a receipt:  
   - **If Yes**: The program generates a `.txt` file with all rental details.  
   - **If No**: The program ends without generating a receipt.
